Write a JavaScript function that checks how similar are two strings, which are passed in to this function as arguments.

See example below ...

```
    This is a string
    There was string
      ^^^^^^^          <-- 7 differences
```

In the above example, the function should return the dynamic string "There are 7 differences".

Please do not look for solved problems on the web. They are too complicated and you are likely to get into rabbit holes. Think about a string as a collection (array) of characters. How would you iterate over them and compare?  What edge conditions should you check for?
